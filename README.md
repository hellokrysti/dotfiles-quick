This is some quick dotfile config changes one can make to more align with the KrystiKandi theme (https://krysti.engineer/krystikandi/) which for ALL these changes isn't a one and done theme installation. Many applications do not tie into how a theme is used and will need additional configurations usually found in the ~/.config/ directory or within dotfiles in your $HOME. I'll cover some simple ones in this GitHub that really just require taking a look at the files and either replacing your own, drop the file in new or taking the colour scheming out and implementing it into your own.<br /><br />
* ~/.config/geany - Includes colour scheme
* ~/.config/musikcube - Includes theme colours
* ~/.config/neofetch - Color and display settings
* ~/.config/oomox - Build KrystiKandi theme yourself using oomox with Krysti preset
* ~/.Xresources - Change DPI
